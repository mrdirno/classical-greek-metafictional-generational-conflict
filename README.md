## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where Alexandros, now a playwright, overhears common Athenians in the agora grossly misinterpreting the message of his latest play.
- Draft the letter Leonidas writes but never sends after learning his son has become a 'maker of fictions'.
- Describe a rehearsal where the actor playing the Minotaur argues with Alexandros about his character's motivation.
- Create the final, climactic dialogue between Alexandros and his father, where myth, legacy, and the 'ditch' collide.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a web experience that allows a reader to toggle between the 'traditional' and 'Alexandrian' versions of the Theseus myth, highlighting the textual changes.
- Create a generative text tool that mimics the style of the novel, producing new philosophical fragments or fatherly admonitions based on user-input themes.
